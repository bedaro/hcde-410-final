# hcde-410-final

This is the final project for HCDE 410. I am proposing to examine wind data around
Puget Sound from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information to assess the
range of winds that should be considered in Puget Sound water quality models, and how
the limitations and uncertainties in this data might contribute to model uncertainty.
