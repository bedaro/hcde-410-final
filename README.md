# hcde-410-final

This is the final project for HCDE 410. I have examined wind data
around Puget Sound from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information
to assess the range of winds that should be considered in Puget Sound water
quality models, and how the limitations and uncertainties in this data might
contribute to model uncertainty.

# Data Sources

Hourly wind speed and direction: ISD-Lite https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd

Direct downloads from this FTP site: ftp://ftp.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite

ENSO history: https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php

ENSO data was manually copied/pasted into a CSV, ending in 2020. For each
month of each year, the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) is given as a three-month
smoothed average.

PDO history: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/pdo/

PDO data was downloaded from the above website. For each month and year from
1854 through early 2021, the PDO index is given.

# Using the Notebooks

* **FetchClimateData.ipynb** downloads the raw climate data files from NOAA
  for each collection of stations and years, cleans up the data, does some
  preliminary analysis on data availability to identify the stations and
  years of interest, then saves the observations for each dataset to separate
  files.
* **DatasetAnalysis.ipynb** is the full writeup and analysis of the datasets.
